### Power Test
Power tests are mainly used to determine the effect, ramifications or impact of something. For example the resulting power of an attempted strike.

#### Notation
```
    :power(VAL)
```
where `VAL` is the Attribute (or another numeric value) in question.

#### Execution
You cast one D6. The number shown determines the result by using the following table.
Under certain circumstances, adjectives can be returned.

| Roll          | Numeric Result                 | Adjective            |
| ------------- |--------------------------------| ---------------------|
| 6             | Double the `VAL`               | :sparkles:Sublime    |
| 5             | `VAL`                          | *None*               |
| 4             | `VAL`                          | *None*               |
| 3             | Half the `VAL` (rounded down)  | *None*               |
| 2             | 1                              | *None*               |
| 1             | 0                              | :shit:Botched        |

#### Results
The power test results in a numeric value and possibly an adjective (:sparkles:Sublime or :shit:Botched).
If not noted otherwise, the adjectives will not have any further effect on the result.

#### Story Implications
You may explain what exactly happened to explain the result, especially when an adjective is returned. For example, explain a :sparkles:Sublime Attack with a very powerful and blood rushed swing of the character. On the other hand, :shit:Botched suggests that the Character failed miserably or comically, sometimes even going as far as hurting himself in the process, e.g. he misjudged the strength of his swing and slipped, hitting his knee with the sword.
