## About Trials
A trial describes a character's action or interaction with variable outcome.
Examples are attacking, picking a lock, trying to run, persuading other characters and casting magical spells can be described as trials.
All Trials can be broken down to a set of standard tests and some "operations", not unlike mathematical operations, that combine them.
The result of a trial can either be numeric, with a value, or boolean, with a state of success or failure.
Trials are notated as terms similar to expressions in mathematics or informatics - but don't worry, it will not be that hard!
