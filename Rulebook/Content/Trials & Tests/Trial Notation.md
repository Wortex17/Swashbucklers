## Trial Notation
An example for a trial expression is the following:

```
    :# power(STR) + distance + 4
```

- The `4` is a *constant* number in that formula, a numerical value that never changes.
- The `+` is an **operation**, summing together the values on its sides. It obeys the same rules as in math!
- The `distance` here is a *variable*. This variable is always explained in the context of the trial
(inside the text somewhere around the depiction of the expression).
- The power() part, is a test that may yield different results, every time a character tries to pass this trial,
as it depends on the throw of dices and attributes of the characters. More about tests later.
- The `#` tells us that the trial results in a numerical value, that will be used in some context (e.g. as damage).
- A trial expression always begins with the result type of the trial.
The current only other result type is boolean, which is notated as a question mark:
```
    :? chance(DEX)
```
- The `:` is the beginning of the trial expression.

The game avoids to use very complex expressions, so donâ€™t worry too much about that.
But we still have to look inside the special operations.
They will a lot of sense once you dive into the game.
